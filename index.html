                                Ticao Island is an island with a total land area of 334 km2 or 129 sq mi. It is one of the three major islands of Masbate province in the Philippines. It is separated from the Bicol Peninsula by the Ticao Pass.

                                The Island is known as an archaeological landscape, possessing thousands of pre-colonial artifacts such as the Baybayin-inscribed Rizal Stone, Ticao gold spike teeth, Burial jars of varying designs and sizes, jade beads, human face rock statues, and the Ticao petrographs. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-10">
                                Much of the homes in Ticao island use these archaeological finds to design their interiors. The island is also an ecological frontier for the conservation of manta rays. The island also possesses a 'rare subspecies' of Visayan warty pig, that is almost near extinction. Penelopides panini ticaensis, or the Ticao hornbill, was a subspecies of the Visayan hornbill (Penelopides panini) known to occur only in Ticao Island.

                          <p class="mb-10">San Jacinto in Ticao Island served as an alternate port call for the galleons. In these ports, the galleons docked for repairs and resupplying of their food provisions during the Manila, Acapulco Galleon Trade.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-10">During those times, San Jacinto became the stop-over of galleons before heading to the Embocadero (San Bernardino Strait) or simply called by the Bisayans as “Tagbaluran”. There are times that ships had to lie for days at the Ports of San Jacinto and some other parts of the island as they wait for the monsoon to break out in order for them to get out of the Strait of San Bernardino.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-10">There is a report which says that a royal order was issued exempting the people of Ticao Island from paying tributes in exchange for servicing the needs of the galleons that called on San Jacinto.

                        sailed across China Sea and the Pacific Ocean for more than two centuries, from 1565 to 1815. 
                        Through all these years, the ships passed through the seas of Masbate in its voyages between Acapulco and Manila (and vice versa), most of them stopping for anchorage in Ticao Island.

                        <strong>In July 1569</strong>, the Augustinian Fray Alonso Jimenez joined the expedition of Capt. Luis de Guzman to explore Masbate, Ticao, Burias and the Bicol Peninsula. Side by side with exploration, he ministered and gave baptism to many local chiefs and their followers. He later returned to Masbate as his base before going back to Cebu in 1572.</p>
                    <p class="mb-40">
                        <strong>In 1594</strong>, at about the time the galleon Trade began in earnest, the Franciscans took over religious administration of the Bicol Peninsula except for the three islands of Masbate, Ticao and Burias. Because of lack of personnel and the fear of Muslim attacks, a hiatus of religious activity followed.

                        <strong>In May 1688</strong>, the Recollects (from Manila) Juan de San Felipe and Juan dela Encarnacion took over administration of the three islands. Several years later they established missions in San Jacinto (Ticao), Masbate and Burias despite difficulties and problems encountered. In time, the supervision of these missions were transferred to Nueva Caceres (Naga).

                    <p class="mb-40">
                        One of these Muslim seaborne patrols arrived early part of <strong>1603</strong> in a vinta and saw the untouched evergreen rolling coastline in what is now Rondahan. The Muslim leader decided to land and investigate and liked what he saw. The group decided to stay, settle in the area and made their first clearing, probably assisted by local natives since all of them were seafaring warriors. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-40">
                        <strong>In 1603</strong>, an English frigate prowling the galleon trade route along the present day Ticao Pass happened to pass by. Noticing the green panoramic vista of the terrain, the Captain became curious about the new settlement and sent a team on a rowboat ashore to investigate and saw a native on top of a rock pounding a vine. The white man motioned his arm in gesture of friendship (at the time the English were friendly to the Muslims who were against the Spaniards)and attempted to ask the name of the island in a foreign tone. The native, trembling in fear answered, "Tigao" the name of the vine he was pounding which is used in poisoning fish. The Englishman thought that the island's name was Tigao and then recorded "Tigao" as the island's name and since then was also used to refer to the new settlement.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-40">
                        <strong>In 1656</strong>, Fr. Pedro Espallergas of Bacon, Sorsogon discovered Abaca hemp, which later became chief export of the region along with precious metais found in the area. These goods became part of the load of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon trade that regularly passes through Ticao Pass. Because of its strategic location along a busy legendary trade route, Tigao prospered and some Spaniards, Portuguese, Chinese, and other migrants came to settle. At this time the initials Muslim settlers must have been overwhelmed by the newcomers, assimilated, or transferred to other places, as they were not heard of again. This could have been one of the reasons why the place became the target of frequent Moro raids after several years of inactivity, it became the barrio of Nueva Caceres (Naga).

                    <p class="mb-40">
                        <strong>In 1701</strong>, under the supervision of Bishop Gregorio Grejolvo who changed the name of Ticao after the native term "Tico" because of its irregular coastline. Later the barrio of Ticao was elevated to a pueblo (town) and became the entreport of sort between the Bicol peninsula and Masbate mainland. But up to now, the term Tigaonon that refer to the residents of San Jacinto, still sticks.

                        <p class="mb-40">
                             Legend has it that in 1718, a ship (probably from Acapulco) was wrecked and sunk due to typhoon in Ticao pass with a handful of survivors blown to the island. One of them was Jacinto, a Franciscan frier who survived because of the bust Sto. Cristo de Burgos which he clinged to in his ordeal in the stormy sea. This carving was believed to be his savior and became the center of generation and celebration that followed. Father Jacinto led a virtuous life in Ticao. He helped the poor, assisted the seek and the needy. He christened the pagans and converted local settlers to Christianity. The Tigaonons revered Jacinto as a model and holy man.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-40">
                            After several years, a ship arrived urging Jacinto to return to his native land. He boarded the ship that day with Sto. Cristo de Burgos and the "retablo" saved from the sea. Barely did the crew raise the 'sail on the mast when a gust of wind blew hard forcing the ship to retum ashore. This happened thrice. On the fourth day, Jacinto taught of leaving Sto. Cristo behind. Then they sailed on as if guided by divine hands under favorable winds. Way back in Ticao, the people constructed a chapel and made Sto. Cristo de Burgos its Patron Saint. This Patron Saint was believed to have saved many people from danger during natural disasters and the infamous Moro raids that frequently happened thereafter. The Tigaonons (for a long time there was only one town in Ticao) remembering Father Jacinto, named the town "San Jacinto" after him who was belived to be a holy man.                        </p>
